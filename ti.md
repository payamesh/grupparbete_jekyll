<h1>The International</h1>

 <br>
 <p> The International is an esports tournament for the video game Dota 2, hosted and produced by its developer, Valve Corporation. The Intentional was first held at Gamescom as a promotional event for the game in 2011, and has since been held annually. The tournament consists of 18 teams, and follows a year-long tournament series known as the Dota Pro Circuit, representing teams from the regions of North America, South America, Southeast Asia, China, Europe, and CIS.

Since 2013, the tournament's prize pool has been crowdfunded via a battle pass system within the game. Each iteration of The International has since surpassed the previous one's prize pool, with the most recent one having one over US$34 million. Winners of the competition receive the largest percentage of the prize pool, as well as the Aegis of Champions trophy with their names engraved on the back. The most recent winner is OG, who are also the only team to win an International more than once.

 <p> Free to Play is a 2014 documentary film by American video game company Valve Corporation. The film takes a critical look at the lives of Benedict "hyhy" Lim, Danil "Dendi" Ishutin and Clinton "Fear" Loomis, three professional Defense of the Ancients (DotA) players who participated in The International, the most lucrative eSports tournament at the time. The central focus of the film is how their commitment to DotA had affected their lives and how this debut tournament for the sequel, Dota 2, would bring more meaning to their struggles.
