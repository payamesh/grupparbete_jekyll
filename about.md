<br><br> is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) mod for the video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, The Frozen Throne. The objective of the game is for each team to destroy their opponents' Ancient, a heavily guarded structure at the opposing corner of the map, which is based on the "Aeon of Strife" map for StarCraft.<br><br> Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied teammates and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games, players level up their heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission.
<br>
<br>
The scenario was developed with the "World Editor" of Reign of Chaos.</p>

<div class="subheader-div">
<h3 class="sub-header">Carry</h3>
<p class="about-text"> 
"Will become more useful later in the game if they gain a significant gold advantage."

A Carry is the hero that the team rallies around in the late game. The role's name is derived from the act of "carrying" a team, which is to bear the responsibility of leading the team to victory. The carry is expected to have the largest contribution to the team, and is critical in winning team fights. Carries typically lack early game power, but scale to be stronger in the late game.

<div class="subheader-div"> 
<h3 class="sub-header">Nuker</h3>
<p class="about-text"> 
"Can quickly kill enemy heroes using high damage spells with low cooldowns."

Nukers are heroes with abilities that deliver high burst damage throughout the game. Their goal is to give the team an advantage by killing enemy heroes before they can react to team fights.

<div class="subheader-div"> 
<h3 class="sub-header">Support</h3>
<p class="about-text"> 
Can focus less on massing gold and items, and more on using their abilities to gain an advantage for the team."

Supports are heroes who keep their allies alive and give them opportunities to earn more gold and experience. Supports will usually come with skills such as healing spells or disables, and generally have low damage output but a powerful (yet situational) nuke. Supports are typically not dependent on items. Most of their gold is spent on items for the benefit of the team.

<h3 class="sub-header">Jungler</h3>
<p class="about-text"> 
"Can farm effectively from neutral creeps inside the jungle early in the game."

Junglers can clear neutral camps at the start of the game. This allows for them to farm without interfering with the other lanes, which can allow allies to benefit from soloing their lane more. Junglers have skills that allow them to convert neutral creeps, summon units, or sustain themselves efficiently.
